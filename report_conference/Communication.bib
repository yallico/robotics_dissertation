	abstract = {There has been increasing interest in deploying a team of robots, or robot swarms, to fulfill certain complicate tasks such as surveillance. Since robot swarms may move to areas of far distance, it is important to have a pervasive networking environment for communications among robots, administrators, and mobile users. In this paper, we first propose a pervasive architecture to integrate wireless mesh networks and robot swarm networks to build a robot swarm communication network within the areas of special interest. Under the proposed architecture, one or more robots can get connected with a nearby mesh router and access the remote server, while a self-organizing mobile ad hoc network is formed within each swarm for communications among the robots. We then address and analyze many important issues and challenges. Finally, we describe our work to enable this architecture through a scalable algorithm for autonomous swarm deployment and {ROBOTRAK}, a socket-based-swarm monitoring and control toolkit. Extensive simulation results and demonstrations are presented to show the desirable features of the proposed algorithm and toolkit. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Most of our experiences, as well as our intuition, are usually built on a linear understanding of systems and processes. Complex systems in general, and more specifically swarm robotics in this context, leverage non-linear effects to self-organize and to ensure that ‘more is different’. In previous work, the non-linear and therefore counter-intuitive effect of ‘less is more’ was shown for a site-selection swarm scenario. Although it seems intuitive that being able to communicate over longer distances should be beneficial, swarms were found to sometimes profit from communication limitations. Here, we build on this work and show the same effect for the collective perception scenario in a dynamic environment. We also find an additional effect that we call ‘slower is faster’: in certain situations, swarms benefit from sampling their environment less frequently. Our findings are supported by an intensive empirical approach and a mean-field model. All our experimental work is based on simulations using the {ARGoS} simulator extended with a simulator of the smart environment for the Kilobot robot called Kilogrid.},

While the robots of many swarm systems communicate via optical links, the underlying channels and their impact on swarm performance are poorly understood. This paper models the optical channel of a widely used robotic platform, the e-puck. It proposes {SwarmCom}, a mobile ad-hoc network for mobile robots. {SwarmCom} has a detector that, with the help of the channel model, was designed to adapt to the environment and nearby robots. Experiments with groups of up to 30 physical e-pucks show that (i) {SwarmCom} outperforms the state-of-the-art infra-red communication software—{libIrcom}—in range (up to 3 times further), bit error rate (between 50 and 63\% lower), or throughput (up to 8 times higher) and that (ii) the maximum number of communication channels per robot is relatively low, which limits the load per robot even for high-density swarms. Using channel coding, the bit error rate can be further reduced at the expense of throughput. {SwarmCom} could have profound implications for swarm robotics, contributing to system understanding and reproducibility, while paving the way for novel applications.},

The study of ant colonies behavior and of their self-organizing capacities is interesting for computer scientists because it provides models of distributed organization which are useful to solve difficult optimization and distributed control problems. In this paper we overview some models derived from the observation of real ants, emphasizing the role played by stigmergy as distributed communication paradigm, and we show how these models have inspired a number of novel algorithms for the solution of distributed optimization and distributed control problems.},

Communication (or the lack of it) is a key design consideration for robot teams. Communication can enable certain types of coordination that would be impossible otherwise. However communication can also add unnecessary cost and complexity. Important research issues regarding communication concern what should be communicated, over what range, and when the communication should occur. We also consider how diverse behaviors might help or hinder a team, and how to measure diversity in the first place. Finally, we show how learning can provide a powerful means for enabling a team to master a task or adapt to changing conditions. We hypothesize that these three topics are critically interrelated in the context of learning swarms, and we suggest research directions to explore them.},

While it is often difficult to directly define the behavior of the agents, simple communication protocols can be defined more easily using prior knowledge about the given task. In this paper, we propose a number of simple communication protocols that can be exploited by deep reinforcement learning to find decentralized control policies in a multi-robot swarm environment. The protocols are based on histograms that encode the local neighborhood relations of the agents and can also transmit task-specific information, such as the shortest distance and direction to a desired target. In our framework, we use an adaptation of Trust Region Policy Optimization to learn complex collaborative tasks, such as formation building and building a communication link. We evaluate our findings in a simulated 2D-physics environment, and compare the implications of different communication protocols.},

	abstract = {To effectively perform collective monitoring of dynamic environments, a robot swarm needs to adapt to changes by processing the latest information and discarding outdated beliefs. We show that in a swarm composed of robots relying on local sensing, adaptation is better achieved if the robots have a shorter rather than longer communication range. This result is in contrast with the widespread belief that more communication links always improve the information exchange on a network. We tasked robots with reaching agreement on the best option currently available in their operating environment. We propose a variety of behaviors composed of reactive rules to process environmental and social information. Our study focuses on simple behaviors based on the voter model—a well-known minimal protocol to regulate social interactions—that can be implemented in minimalistic machines. Although different from each other, all behaviors confirm the general result: The ability of the swarm to adapt improves when robots have fewer communication links. The average number of links per robot reduces when the individual communication range or the robot density decreases. The analysis of the swarm dynamics via mean-field models suggests that our results generalize to other systems based on the voter model. Model predictions are confirmed by results of multiagent simulations and experiments with 50 Kilobot robots. Limiting the communication to a local neighborhood is a cheap decentralized solution to allow robot swarms to adapt to previously unknown information that is locally observed by a minority of the robots.},

	abstract = {Multi-robot systems gain considerable attention due to lower cost, better robustness, and higher scalability as compared with single-robot systems. Cooperative object transport, as a well-known use case of multi-robot systems, shows great potential in real-world applications. The design and implementation of a multi-robot system involve many technologies, specifically, communication, coordination, task allocation methods, experimental platforms, and simulators. However, most of recent multi-robot system studies focus on coordination and task allocation problems, with little focus on communications among multiple robots. In this review, we focus on the communication, validation platform, and simulator of multi-robot systems, and discuss one of the important applications, cooperative object transport. First, we study the multi-robot system fundamentals and comprehensively review the multi-robot system communication technologies. Then, the multi-robot system validating platform, testbed, simulator, and middleware used in academia and industry are investigated. Finally, we discuss recent advances in cooperative object transport, and challenges and possible future research directions for multi-robot systems.},

In embodied evolution, robots send and receive genomes from their neighbors and generate an offspring genome from the exchanged genomes. This study focused on the effects of the communication range for exchanging genomes on the evolvability of embodied evolution. Experiments were conducted using computer simulations, where robot controllers were evolved during a two-target navigation task. The results of the experiments showed that the robotic swarm could achieve better performance by reducing the communication range for exchanging genomes.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.1207.5839},
	abstract = {We study the effect of communication delays on distributed consensus algorithms. Two ways to model delays on a network are presented. The first model assumes that each link delivers messages with a fixed (constant) amount of delay, and the second model is more realistic, allowing for i.i.d. time-varying bounded delays. In contrast to previous work studying the effects of delays on consensus algorithms, the models studied here allow for a node to receive multiple messages from the same neighbor in one iteration. The analysis of the fixed delay model shows that convergence to a consensus is guaranteed and the rate of convergence is reduced by no more than a factor O(B{\textasciicircum}2) where B is the maximum delay on any link. For the time-varying delay model we also give a convergence proof which, for row-stochastic consensus protocols, is not a trivial consequence of ergodic matrix products. In both delay models, the consensus value is no longer the average, even if the original protocol was an averaging protocol. For this reason, we propose the use of a different consensus algorithm called Push-Sum [Kempe et al. 2003]. We model delays in the Push-Sum framework and show that convergence to the average consensus is guaranteed. This suggests that Push-Sum might be a better choice from a practical standpoint.},
