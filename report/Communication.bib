	abstract = {Swarming and emergent behaviour techniques can offer simple control schemes for the organisation of many nodes, with little communications overhead and processing time. These mechanisms are robust against node losses, and are able to run on cheap, disposable platforms. This article examines the usefulness of a swarming technique to address data ferrying in disconnected networks to provide delay-tolerant type communications. Mathematical analysis of a pheromone-based ferrying approach reveals a robust solution to the round-robin ferrying problem. Simulation results from static and dynamic network topologies agree with the mathematical model and show encouraging results in coordinating data ferries in a disconnected environment.

	abstract = {Mobile ad hoc networks ({MANET}) have a set of unique challenges, particularly due to mobility of nodes, that need to be addressed to realize their full potentials. Because the mobile nodes of a {MANET} are free to move rapidly and arbitrarily, the network topology may change unexpectedly. This paper presents a decentralized approach to maintain the connectivity of a {MANET} using autonomous, intelligent agents. Autonomous agents are special mobile nodes in a {MANET}, but unlike other nodes, their function is to proactively prevent network bottlenecks and service problems by intelligently augmenting the network topology. To achieve this function without depending on a central network management system, autonomous agents are expected to dynamically relocate themselves as the topology of the network changes during the mission time. A flocking-based heuristic algorithm is proposed to determine agent locations. A computational study is performed to investigate the effect of basic flocking behaviors on the connectivity of a {MANET}.},

In this paper, we first propose a pervasive architecture to integrate wireless mesh networks and robot swarm networks to build a robot swarm communication network within the areas of special interest. Under the proposed architecture, one or more robots can get connected with a nearby mesh router and access the remote server, while a self-organizing mobile ad hoc network is formed within each swarm for communications among the robots. We then address and analyze many important issues and challenges. Finally, we describe our work to enable this architecture through a scalable algorithm for autonomous swarm deployment and {ROBOTRAK}, a socket-based-swarm monitoring and control toolkit.

We propose a class of protocols based on the connectivity-through-time concepts that exploit the robot movements to extend the traditional notions of network connectivity. These protocols enable the formation of adhoc networks of mobile robots without the infrastructure of access points by utilizing the robots as routers. These protocols are implemented as a collection of daemons that track connectivity changes, compute single and multiple hop connectivity, route the packets via robots with suitable buffering, and adapt the transport parameters to the connection characteristics. The implementation employs {UDP} with window-based flow control that is tuned to the nature of connections. We present experimental performance results based on our implementation on robot teams to illustrate the salient features of this approach.},

	abstract = {Mobile robots need to be able to communicate among them, as well as with hosts participating in the task all of them are involved in. Wired networks are obviously not suitable for mobile robots. Cur- rent wireless networks based on fixed infrastructure ({GSM}, {WiFi}, etc.) to route packets are neither suitable because this infraestructure does not cover every place. The best alternative for mobile robots are Ad-Hoc networks, which are wireless networks that do not need a fixed infras- tructure. This article describes {PERA}, an adaptation of a well-known Ad-Hoc routing protocol for mobile robots with reduced communications capabilities. This protocol has been iplemented and tested on Eyebot mo- bile robots. Robots using {PERA} can send messages to other robots or hosts that are not directly reachable through its radio antenna covarage, by routing messages through intermediate mobile robots also running {PERA}. The design, implementation, testing and lessons learned in de- velopment of {PERA} are presented in this article.},

	abstract = {Most of our experiences, as well as our intuition, are usually built on a linear understanding of systems and processes. Complex systems in general, and more specifically swarm robotics in this context, leverage non-linear effects to self-organize and to ensure that ‘more is different’. In previous work, the non-linear and therefore counter-intuitive effect of ‘less is more’ was shown for a site-selection swarm scenario. Although it seems intuitive that being able to communicate over longer distances should be beneficial, swarms were found to sometimes profit from communication limitations. Here, we build on this work and show the same effect for the collective perception scenario in a dynamic environment. We also find an additional effect that we call ‘slower is faster’: in certain situations, swarms benefit from sampling their environment less frequently. Our findings are supported by an intensive empirical approach and a mean-field model. All our experimental work is based on simulations using the {ARGoS} simulator extended with a simulator of the smart environment for the Kilobot robot called Kilogrid.},

The robots need to service events that present themselves in different locations within a confined area. We focus on the task of robot navigation: how can robots of the swarm assist each other to reach event locations. We present two solutions based on the use of routing information set up in a mobile ad hoc network created among the robots. Communication in this network relies on an infrared range and bearing device, which is able to transfer data between two robots as well as to make estimates of the relative distance and angle between them. Using this device, one can relate links in the communication network to relative geographic location information. We then use an ad hoc network routing protocol to dynamically find and maintain paths between a robot and an event location in the communication network and use them to guide the robot to its goal. An important advantage of our approach is that robots can transparently help each other for navigation without having to adapt their own movements, so that they can be involved in independent tasks of their own.},

	abstract = {Robot swarming, increasingly find importance in the last decade. In these systems, multi mobile robots have to work cooperatively to perform specified tasks. One of the compelling problems is that the robots movements should be in such a way that they should follow a specific guide and at the same time they should have the ability of obstacle avoidance. Inspiriting such movement from biological swarms is a compelling problem. Fish schools, bird flocks and sheep herds are particular examples of biological systems swarming. In this paper, a robot swarming algorithm was developed based on swarming rules noticed in these biological systems, the combination between the swarm members and the leadership control also explained, an ad-hoc non-essential communication system was proposed for the purpose of use in case of collective takeoff and collective landing swarm-robots, in which activated automatically.},

Simulation tests are presented to show the effectiveness of our proposed ant-based task robot coordination with only the exploration task and with both exploration and recruiting strategies. Multiple minimization objectives have been considered: the robots’ recruiting time and the overall area exploration time.

Experiments with groups of up to 30 physical e-pucks show that (i) {SwarmCom} outperforms the state-of-the-art infra-red communication software—{libIrcom}—in range (up to 3 times further), bit error rate (between 50 and 63\% lower), or throughput (up to 8 times higher) and that (ii) the maximum number of communication channels per robot is relatively low, which limits the load per robot even for high-density swarms. Using channel coding, the bit error rate can be further reduced at the expense of throughput. {SwarmCom} could have profound implications for swarm robotics, contributing to system understanding and reproducibility, while paving the way for novel applications.},

Moreover, if the robot detects more than one network, it has the essential knowledge to choose the best one and to start communicating using that channel. The main goal of this project is to make the robot able to employ, always and everywhere, the best available way of communicating, by supplying it with the capability of deciding if the current connection is the best it could actually exploit, or if it would be useful to switch to another channel. This task is completed without any awareness of the context in which the robot is; this means that the robot can immediately start working in every new place it is located, with no need for reconfiguration.},

Communication between the robots can multiply their capabilities and effectiveness, but to what extent? In this research, the importance of communication in robotic societies is investigated through experiments on both simulated and real robots. Performance was measured for three different types of communication for three different tasks. The levels of communication are progressively more complex and potentially more expensive to implement. For some tasks, communication can significantly improve performance, but for others inter-agent communication is apparently unnecessary. In cases where communication helps, the lowest level of communication is almost as effective as the more complex type. The bulk of these results are derived from thousands of simulations run with randomly generated initial conditions. The simulation results help determine appropriate parameters for the reactive control system which was ported for tests on Denning mobile robots.},

Several robotics implementations of this paradigm confirm that these properties can be exploited for the control of a population of physically independent mobile robots.

The work presented here introduces a new robotic concept called swarm-bot in which the collective interaction exploited by the swarm intelligence mechanism goes beyond the control layer and is extended to the physical level. This implies the addition of new mechanical functionalities on the single robot, together with new electronics and software to manage it. These new functionalities, even if not directly related to mobility and navigation, allow to address complex mobile robotics problems, such as extreme all-terrain exploration.

The work shows also how this new concept is investigated using a simulation tool (swarmbot3d) specifically developed for quickly designing and evaluating new control algorithms. Experimental work shows how the simulated detailed representation of one s-bot has been calibrated to match the behaviour of the real robot.},

In this paper we overview some models derived from the observation of real ants, emphasizing the role played by stigmergy as distributed communication paradigm, and we show how these models have inspired a number of novel algorithms for the solution of distributed optimization and distributed control problems.},

	abstract = {Many structures built by social insects are the outcome of a process of self-organization, in which the repeated actions of the insects interact over time with the changing physical environment to produce a characteristic end state. A major mediating factor is stigmergy, the elicitation of specific environment-changing behaviors by the sensory effects of local environmental changes produced by previous behavior. A typical task involving stigmergic self-organization is brood sorting: Many ant species sort their brood so that items at similar stages of development are grouped together and separated from items at different stages of development. This article examines the operation of stigmergy and self-organization in a homogeneous group of physical robots, in the context of the task of clustering and sorting Frisbees of two different types. Using a behavioral rule set simpler than any yet proposed for ant sorting, and having no capacity for spatial orientation or memory, the robots are able to achieve effective clustering and sorting showing all the signs of self-organization. It is argued that the success of this demonstration is crucially dependent on the exploitation of real-world physics, and that the use of simulation alone to investigate stigmergy may fail to reveal its power as an evolutionary option for collective life forms.},

	abstract = {Tropical ants experience intense intra- and interspecific competition for food sources, which influences their activity pattern and foraging strategies. Even though different ant species can coexist through spatial and temporal niche partitioning, direct competition for food cannot be avoided. Recruitment communication is assumed to help colonies to monopolize and exploit food sources successfully, but this has rarely been tested under field conditions. We studied if recruitment communication helps colonies of the Neotropical ant Pachycondyla harpax to be more successful in a highly competitive tropical environment. Additionally, we explored if temporal and spatial niche differentiation helps focal colonies to avoid competition. Pachycondyla harpax competed with dozens of ant species for food. Mass-recruiting competitors were often successful in displacing P. harpax from food baits. However, when foragers of P. harpax were able to recruit nestmates they had a 4-times higher probability to keep access to the food baits. Colonies were unlikely to be displaced during our observations after a few ants arrived at the food source. Competition was more intense after sunset, but a disproportionate increase in activity after sunset allowed focal colonies to exploit food sources more successfully after sunset. Our results support the hypothesis that recruitment communication helps colonies to monopolize food sources by helping them to establish a critical mass of nestmates at large resources. This indicates that even species with a small colony size and a slow recruitment method, such as tandem running, benefit from recruitment communication in a competitive environment.},

The problem that restricts robot developers in current cloud robot research is the lack of a safe way to transmit messages between edge and cloud. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the {RCC} (Robot Cloud Communication), a Python-based software library, which can help swarm intelligence robots data to be efficiently and securely transferred to different types of business clouds or private cloud platforms. In addition, we integrate the {RCC} function library and can also provide high-quality data security guarantees for development users when sending and receiving data. Through our approach, we successfully implemented the development of an indoor 3D map application which is difficult to achieve on a single robot platform. Our experimental results show that our {RCC} is not only very stable in performance of reading and writing, but also shows great performance in data encryption and decryption.},

We first formalize the notion of optimal path in {DTN}, then introduce a swarm intelligence based routing protocol adapted to content centric {DTN} that use a publish/subscribe communication paradigm. The protocol works in a fully decentralized way in which nodes do not have any knowledge about the global topology. Nodes, via opportunistic contacts, update utility functions which synthesizes their spatio-temporal proximity from the content subscribers. This individual behavior applied by each node leads to the collective formation of gradient fields between content subscribers and content providers. Therefore, content routing simply sums up to follow the steepest slope along these gradient fields to reach subscribers who are located at the minima of the field. Via real traces analysis and simulation, we demonstrate the existence and relevance of such gradient field and show routing performance improvements when compared to classical routing protocols previously defined for information routing in {DTN}.},

For example, storing information about the topography of the explored terrain or the natural dangers in the environment can inform the decision-making process of the robots. Therefore, it is crucial to store these data safely and to make it available quickly to the operators of the robotic system. In a decentralized system like a swarm of robots, this entails several challenges. To address them, we propose {RASS}, a decentralized risk-aware swarm storage and routing mechanism, which relies exclusively on local information sharing between neighbours to establish storage and routing fitness. We test our system through thorough experiments in a physics-based simulator and test its real-world applicability with physical experiments. We obtain convincing reliability, routing speeds, and swarm storage capacity results.},

We assume that external storage infrastructure is absent, and that each robot is capable of devoting a quota of memory and bandwidth to distributed storage. Our approach is motivated by the insight that in many applications data is collected at the periphery of a swarm topology, but the periphery also happens to be the most dangerous location for storing data, especially in exploration missions. Our approach is designed to promote data storage in the locations in the swarm that best suit a specific feature of interest in the data, while accounting for the constantly changing topology due to individual motion. We analyze two possible features of interest: the data type and the data item position in the environment. We assess the performance of our approach in a large set of simulated experiments. The evaluation shows that our approach is capable of storing quantities of data that exceed the memory of individual robots, while maintaining near-perfect data retention in high-load conditions.},

	abstract = {In emergency scenarios where the on-site information is completely lacking or the original environmental state has been completely changed, autonomous and mobile swarm robotics are used to quickly build a rescue support system to ensure the safety of follow-up rescuers and improve rescue efficiency. To address the data security problem caused by the complex and changeable topology of the heterogeneous swarm robotics network in the process of building the rescue support system, this paper introduced a decentralized data security communication scheme for heterogeneous swarm robotics. First, we built a decentralized network topology model by using base robot, communication robotics, and business robotics, and it can ensure the stability of the system. Moreover, based on the decentralized network topology model, we designed a storage model using the master–slave blockchain method. The master chain is composed of base robot and communication robotics, which mainly store the digests of robot data in multiple slave chains to reach the global data consensus of the system. The slave chains are composed of business robotics and communication robotics, which mainly store all data on the slave chains to reach the local data consensus of the system. The whole data storage system adopts the Delegated Proof of Stake consensus mechanism to elect proxy nodes to participate in the data consensus tasks in the system and to ensure the data consistency of each robot node in the decentralized network. Additionally, a prototype of the heterogeneous swarm robotics system based on the master–slave chains is constructed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The experimental results show that the scheme effectively solves the data security problem caused by the unstable communication link of the heterogeneous swarm robotics system.},

Communication (or the lack of it) is a key design consideration for robot teams. Communication can enable certain types of coordination that would be impossible otherwise. However communication can also add unnecessary cost and complexity. Important research issues regarding communication concern what should be communicated, over what range, and when the communication should occur. We also consider how diverse behaviors might help or hinder a team, and how to measure diversity in the first place. Finally, we show how learning can provide a powerful means for enabling a team to master a task or adapt to changing conditions. We hypothesize that these three topics are critically interrelated in the context of learning swarms, and we suggest research directions to explore them.},

	abstract = {Swarm Robotics ({SR}) is an extension of the study of Multi-Robot Systems that exploits concepts of communication, coordination and collaboration among a large number of robots. The massive parallelization yielded by the robots working together can make a task faster than in the case of the usage of a single complex robot. One of the main aspects in robotic swarms is that the control is decentralized by definition and distributed among the robots of the swarm, improving the system robustness and fault-tolerance. Furthermore, this characteristic often allows the emergence of collective behaviors from the robot's interaction with each other and with the environment through their embodied sensors and actuators. In most cases, the number of inputs from sensor readings turns analytical solutions hard or even impossible. Thus, many ad-hoc approaches are contributed to deal with the situation at hand. The main goal of this review is to find out, through the study of existing research works of the field, the reason behind the lack of exploitation of swarm robotic systems in real-world applications. For this purpose, we first review the different possibilities of study in {SR}: physical and simulated robotic platforms, development methodologies and the variety of basic tasks and collective behaviors. We then briefly describe some fields related do {SR} that have a big impact on the development of {SR}. After that, based on existing taxonomies found in literature, we categorize existing research works regarding {SR} in two large main groups: those that deal with {SR} design and those that deal with tasks as required in {SR}. The review of both existing robots and techniques in the literature show a diversity of approaches to discuss {SR} issues. Nonetheless, it is easily noticeable from these works that there is a clamant absence of solid real-world applications of {SR}. An analysis of the interests and bottlenecks of this field indicates that the number of research works is smaller than those in other related areas. This suggests that, even though with many research studies, the field of {SR} is not yet mature enough, mainly due the absence of a universal methodology and generic robots that can be used in any, or at least in many, applications. Thus, we emphasize, discuss and analyze the urgent need for standardization of many aspects in {SR}, including hardware and software, as to allow a possible flourishing of {SR} applicability to real-world applications. This standardization could accelerate a great deal the field of {SR}, thus facilitating the development of {SR} solutions for applications that impact our daily life.},

This paper presents the {WsBot}, a tiny swarm robot of low cost, designed mainly, but not restricted, for the testing in smart factories. This robot is specially designed to present similar features of industrial agents, e.g., forklifts aiming to achieve the autonomous intelligent behaviors, individually, in groups or terms of the global task. The {WsBot} is a tiny differential robot, {ROS}-based, capable of executing its behavior and connects with other agents through Wi-Fi. These characteristics allow this robot to serve as a bridge so that researches, that until then were restricted to the theoretical and academic environment can effectively bring real contributions to smart factories.},

	abstract = {Swarm intelligence principles have been widely studied and applied to a number of different tasks where a group of autonomous robots is used to solve a problem with a distributed approach, i.e. without central coordination. A survey of such tasks is presented, illustrating various algorithms that have been used to tackle the challenges imposed by each task. Aggregation, flocking, foraging, object clustering and sorting, navigation, path formation, deployment, collaborative manipulation and task allocation problems are described in detail, and a high-level overview is provided for other swarm robotics tasks. For each of the main tasks, (1) swarm design methods are identified, (2) past works are divided in task-specific categories, and (3) mathematical models and performance metrics are described. Consistently with the swarm intelligence paradigm, the main focus is on studies characterized by distributed control, simplicity of individual robots and locality of sensing and communication. Distributed algorithms are shown to bring cooperation between agents, obtained in various forms and often without explicitly programming a cooperative behavior in the single robot controllers. Offline and online learning approaches are described, and some examples of past works utilizing these approaches are reviewed.},

	abstract = {We study self-organized cooperation between heterogeneous robotic swarms. The robots of each swarm play distinct roles based on their different characteristics. We investigate how the use of simple local interactions between the robots of the different swarms can let the swarms cooperate in order to solve complex tasks. We focus on an indoor navigation task, in which we use a swarm of wheeled robots, called foot-bots, and a swarm of flying robots that can attach to the ceiling, called eye-bots. The task of the foot-bots is to move back and forth between a source and a target location. The role of the eye-bots is to guide foot-bots: they choose positions at the ceiling and from there give local directional instructions to foot-bots passing by. To obtain efficient paths for foot-bot navigation, eye-bots need on the one hand to choose good positions and on the other hand learn the right instructions to give. We investigate each of these aspects. Our solution is based on a process of mutual adaptation, in which foot-bots execute instructions given by eye-bots, and eye-bots observe the behavior of foot-bots to adapt their position and the instructions they give. Our approach is inspired by pheromone mediated navigation of ants, as eye-bots serve as stigmergic markers for foot-bot navigation. Through simulation, we show how this system is able to find efficient paths in complex environments, and to display different kinds of complex and scalable self-organized behaviors, such as shortest path finding and automatic traffic spreading.},

The model is able to quantitatively and qualitatively predict the dynamics observed in extensive realistic multi-robot simulation, and provides qualitative agreement with data obtained from aggregation of Blattela germanica larvae.

Novel design choices in {ARGoS} have enabled this breakthrough. First, in {ARGoS}, it is possible to partition the simulated space into multiple sub-spaces, managed by different physics engines running in parallel. Second, {ARGoS}’ architecture is multi-threaded, thus designed to optimize the usage of modern multi-core {CPUs}. Finally, the architecture of {ARGoS} is highly modular, enabling easy addition of custom features and appropriate allocation of computational resources. We assess the efficiency of {ARGoS} and showcase its flexibility with targeted experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that simulation run-time increases linearly with the number of robots. A 2D-dynamics simulation of 10,000 e-puck robots can be performed in 60 \% of the time taken by the corresponding real-world experiment. We show how {ARGoS} can be extended to suit the needs of an experiment in which custom functionality is necessary to achieve sufficient simulation accuracy. {ARGoS} is open source software licensed under {GPL}3 and is downloadable free of charge.},

Our case study has been carefully chosen to represent a swarm task in which the overall desired system behaviour is an emergent property of the interactions between robots, in order that we can assess the fault tolerance of a self-organising system. Our findings show that in the presence of worst-case partially failed robots the overall system reliability quickly falls with increasing swarm size. We conclude that future large scale swarm systems will need a new approach to achieving high levels of fault tolerance.},

This branch of knowledge is known as Swarm Robotics.
This concept is widely conceived as the modeling and development of tools and techniques based on the coordination of multiple small-sized robots towards the accomplishment of difficult tasks or missions in a collaborative way. The success of Swarm Robotics applications comes from the efficient use of the smart sensing, communication and organization functionalities of these small robots, which allow to gather information, operate and infer knowledge from the environment in a collaborative manner.

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel distributed and parallel self-assembly approach, which uses the lattice system as a systematic structure and homogeneous robots as shaping carriers to form a two-dimensional user-specified shape autonomously. Given a desired shape to be formed, the initial shape matches with it to execute the initialization of all individuals to allow each of them gets its location and status. Based on that, with the stratified mechanism, the macro-level behavior of large-scale group formation in swarm robotics is transformed to local formation action of individuals within the edge layers of the current aggregate, which makes complex shape formation possible. Then two motion-chains, a collection of individuals that have priority to move currently, are autonomously planning in parallel through local interaction and collaboration. Once all robots within a motion-chain are activated, each of them will move along the outer edge of the current aggregate orderly to fill the edge-filling layer efficiently. The motion-chains will be iteratively generated until the desired shape is formed. We evaluate the feasibility and scalability of this novel approach in simulation-based experiments, and implement the self-assembly algorithm on the Rubik robot, a hardware system developed in our lab.},

It is not flexible, and also has low transparency and tracking capabilities. Blockchain, a decentralized technology based on peer to peer communication along with smart contracts, can be a potential contender for addressing these challenges. However, blockchains are resource‐intensive and not found suitable for resource‐constrained devices. We propose a blockchain‐based framework, which is based on Proof‐of‐Authority ({PoA}) consensus mechanism to ensure efficiency. We experiment with test‐bed implementation using {RaspberryPi}. The results obtained demonstrate that the {PoA} mechanism is not a resource‐hungry one (unlike other state‐of‐the‐art consensus mechanisms).

In this work, we introduce and investigate the multi-feature collective decision making problem, where a collective must decide on multiple binary features simultaneously, given no a priori information about their relative difficulties. Each agent may only estimate one feature at any given time, but the agents can locally communicate their noisy estimates to arrive at a decision. We demonstrate a decentralized algorithm for single-feature decision making and a dynamic task allocation strategy that allows the agents to lock in decisions on multiple features in finite time. We validate our approach using simulated and physical Kilobot robots. Our results show that a collective can correctly classify a multi-feature environment, even if presented with pathological initial agent-to-feature allocations.},

While a general-purpose methodology is currently out of reach, specific solutions can be given to broad classes of problems by means of well-conceived design patterns. We propose a design pattern for collective decision making grounded on experimental/theoretical studies of the nest-site selection behaviour observed in honeybee swarms (Apis mellifera). The way in which honeybee swarms arrive at consensus is fairly well-understood at the macroscopic level. We provide formal guidelines for the microscopic implementation of collective decisions to quantitatively match the macroscopic predictions. We discuss implementation strategies based on both homogeneous and heterogeneous multiagent systems, and we provide means to deal with spatial and topological factors that have a bearing on the micro-macro link. Finally, we exploit the design pattern in two case studies that showcase the viability of the approach. Besides engineering, such a design pattern can prove useful for a deeper understanding of decision making in natural systems thanks to the inclusion of individual heterogeneities and spatial factors, which are often disregarded in theoretical modelling.},

	abstract = {Multiple-robot systems ({MRS}) that are decentrally organized have many benefits over centralized systems. Decentralized systems are less affected by computational and communicative bottlenecks, and they are more robust to the loss of individual member robots. System-level cognitive operations, though, are much more difficult to implement in decentralized systems. One example is the best-of-N decision-making problem, in which a team attempts to unanimously select a single alternative from a list that maximizes a given metric. This is a valuable operation, since many system-level operations can be expressed in this form. Optimal best-of-N decision-making, however, is intractable in large decentralized systems. The contribution of this paper is a biologically inspired algorithm that enables a decentralized {MRS} composed of very simple robots to make good, unanimous decisions. In a series of physical experiments using real robots, the best decision was made at least 80\% of the time. In all, 100\% of the decisions achieved perfect consensus, which prevented the {MRS} from becoming fragmented. The decisions are made using anonymous, local communication, with no direct comparisons of the available alternatives by the individual robots.},

Emergent global behaviour is achieved through the multiple interactions of locally communicating agents. Collectively, the robots hunt a moving target, immobilise that target and then hunt the next target. Using explicit communication over limited local range, the robots exchange their internal state vectors with neighbouring robots and update their internal states using deterministic transition rules. Configurations of a robot’s internal states and local sensor information are then translated into motion. The results demonstrate that the developed swarming algorithm is scalable and by exploiting the distributedness of the swarm shows an increasing success rate for increasing swarm sizes in domains of high noise.

	abstract = {Swarm systems constitute a challenging problem for reinforcement learning ({RL}) as the algorithm needs to learn decentralized control policies that can cope with limited local sensing and communication abilities of the agents. While it is often difficult to directly define the behavior of the agents, simple communication protocols can be defined more easily using prior knowledge about the given task. In this paper, we propose a number of simple communication protocols that can be exploited by deep reinforcement learning to find decentralized control policies in a multi-robot swarm environment. The protocols are based on histograms that encode the local neighborhood relations of the agents and can also transmit task-specific information, such as the shortest distance and direction to a desired target. In our framework, we use an adaptation of Trust Region Policy Optimization to learn complex collaborative tasks, such as formation building and building a communication link. We evaluate our findings in a simulated 2D-physics environment, and compare the implications of different communication protocols.},

The efficiency of overall information integration between decentralized and distributed agents can show major impacts on the collective behaviour of the swarm. It is crucial to establish an approach that bridges an existing gap present between realistic swarm robotic system and real-world enforcements. Therefore, this review paper vividly captures the challenges faced in control and information integration mechanisms within swarm robotic systems, and how recent developments enable tangible benefits to multiple industries as a whole. A comprehensive overview on the current advancements and challenges faced in effective sharing of important information via Pheromonal Communication is also presented. Besides, this paper also discusses the recent advancements pertaining to the information integration systems in one of the major swarm robotic system applications, namely the Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. Forthcoming promising applications with good potential to surpass the recent dilemmas were also explored and analyzed at the end of this paper, with discussions on possible gaps to close in order to enable further enhancements on the efficiency of information integration in swarm robotic systems.},

	abstract = {To effectively perform collective monitoring of dynamic environments, a robot swarm needs to adapt to changes by processing the latest information and discarding outdated beliefs. We show that in a swarm composed of robots relying on local sensing, adaptation is better achieved if the robots have a shorter rather than longer communication range. This result is in contrast with the widespread belief that more communication links always improve the information exchange on a network. We tasked robots with reaching agreement on the best option currently available in their operating environment. We propose a variety of behaviors composed of reactive rules to process environmental and social information. Our study focuses on simple behaviors based on the voter model—a well-known minimal protocol to regulate social interactions—that can be implemented in minimalistic machines. Although different from each other, all behaviors confirm the general result: The ability of the swarm to adapt improves when robots have fewer communication links. The average number of links per robot reduces when the individual communication range or the robot density decreases. The analysis of the swarm dynamics via mean-field models suggests that our results generalize to other systems based on the voter model. Model predictions are confirmed by results of multiagent simulations and experiments with 50 Kilobot robots. Limiting the communication to a local neighborhood is a cheap decentralized solution to allow robot swarms to adapt to previously unknown information that is locally observed by a minority of the robots.},

In both cases, the algorithm provides efficient navigation, while being robust to failures of robots in the swarm. Moreover, we show that in the latter case, the system lets the swarm self-organize into a robust dynamic structure.

Its purpose is to carry out complex missions involving Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance ({ISR}), Suppression of Enemy Aerial Defenses ({SEAD}), Destruction of Enemy Aerial Defenses ({DEAD}), Close Air Support ({CAS}), and other functions in an environment characterized by large uncertainty and vehicle loss or failures. The architecture is referred to as the Collaborative Mission Planning \& Autonomous Control Technology ({CoMPACT}) and consists of six coordinated hierarchical layers encompassing tasks and objectives from the mission planning stage to the {UAV} task execution level. The main advantage of the {CoMPACT} system is that it effectively combines mission planning using evolutionary algorithms, hybrid automata-based task execution at each hierarchical layer, and biologically-inspired emergent swarm behaviors. Judicious combination and coordination of these capabilities results in a system that is scalable to architectures involving a very large number of autonomous agents in which mission-relevant objectives are accomplished in highly uncertain dynamic environments through real-time mission re-planning, dynamic agent-to-task assignment, and reactive motion planning. Through simulation and experiment, the {CoMPACT} system is shown to be robust to intermittent loss of communications and communication delays, and to dynamic changes in the environment such as moving targets, unknown targets and obstacles, pop-up threats, vehicular failures and loss of agents. The {CoMPACT} system has been extensively tested on a Matlab simulation of a realistic mission scenario involving {ISR}, {SEAD} and {DEAD} functions, and simple models of {UAV} dynamics operating in a dynamic threat and target-rich environment.},

	abstract = {To simplify the usage of the Unmanned Aerial Systems ({UAS}), extending their use to a great number of applications, fully autonomous operation is needed. There are many open-source architecture frameworks for {UAS} that claim the autonomous operation of {UAS}, but they still have two main open issues: (1) level of autonomy, being in most of the cases limited and (2) versatility, being most of them designed specifically for some applications or aerial platforms. As a response to these needs and issues, this paper presents Aerostack, a system architecture and open-source multi-purpose software framework for autonomous multi-{UAS} operation. To provide higher degrees of autonomy, Aerostack's system architecture integrates state of the art concepts of intelligent, cognitive and social robotics, based on five layers: reactive, executive, deliberative, reflective, and social. To be a highly versatile practical solution, Aerostack's open-source software framework includes the main components to execute the architecture for fully autonomous missions of swarms of {UAS}; a collection of ready-to-use and flight proven modular components that can be reused by the users and developers; and compatibility with five well known aerial platforms, as well as a high number of sensors. Aerostack has been validated during three years by its successful use on many research projects, international competitions and exhibitions. To corroborate this fact, this paper also presents Aerostack carrying out a fictional fully autonomous indoors search and rescue mission.},

The sizes of these structures and the necessary level of detail in each mission requires a conflicting set of multi-objective goals, such as performance, quality, and safety. It is challenging for human operators, or simple autonomous path-following drones, to process all this information, and thus, it is common that a mission must be repeated several times until it succeeds. This paper deals with this problem by developing a new cognitive architecture based on a collaborative environment between the unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAVs}) and other agents focusing on optimizing the data gathering, information processing, and decision-making. The proposed architecture breaks the problem into independent units ranging from sensors and actuators up to high-level intelligence processes. It organizes the structures into data and information; each agent may request an individual behavior from the system. To deal with conflicting behaviors, a supervisory agent analyzes all requests and defines the final planning. This architecture enables real-time decision-making with intelligent social behavior among the agents. Thus, it is possible to process and make decisions about the best way to accomplish the mission. To present the methodology, slope inspection scenarios are shown.},

Given range sensor measurements and the positions of other robots, the policy aims to generate control commands for navigation and preserve the global connectivity of the robot team. We incorporate connectivity concerns into the {RL} framework as constraints and introduce behavior cloning to reduce the exploration complexity of policy optimization. The policy is optimized with all transition data collected by multiple robots in random simulated scenarios. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing different combinations of connectivity constraints and behavior cloning. We also show that our policy can generalize to unseen scenarios in both simulation and holonomic robots experiments.},

	abstract = {A large group of robots will often be partitioned into subgroups, each subgroup performing a different task. This paper presents four distributed algorithms for assigning swarms of homogenous robots to subgroups to meet a specified global task distribution. Algorithm Random-Choice selects tasks randomly, but runs in constant time. Algorithm Extreme-Comm compiles a complete inventory of all the robots on every robot, runs quickly, but uses a great deal of communication. The Card- Dealer's algorithm assigns tasks to individual robots sequentially, using minimal communications but a great deal of time. The Tree- Recolor algorithm is a compromise between Extreme-Comm and Card-Dealer's, balancing communications use and running time. The three deterministic algorithms drive the system towards the desired assignment of subtasks with high accuracy. We implement the algorithms on a group of 25 {iRobot} {SwarmBots}, and collect and analyze performance data.},

The Kilogrid has been designed to extend the sensory-motor abilities of the Kilobot, to simplify the task of collecting data during experiments, and to provide researchers with a tool to fine-control the experimental setup and its parameters. Based on the design of the Kilobot and compatible with existing hardware, the Kilogrid is a modular system composed of a grid of computing nodes, or modules that provides a bidirectional communication channel between the Kilobots and a remote workstation. In this paper, we describe the hardware and software architecture of the Kilogrid system as well as its functioning to accompany its release as a new open hardware tool for the swarm robotics community. We demonstrate the capabilities of the Kilogrid using a 200-module Kilogrid, swarms of up to 100 Kilobots, and four different case studies: exploration and obstacle avoidance, site selection based on multiple gradients, plant watering, and pheromone-based foraging. Through this set of case studies, we show how the Kilogrid allows the experimenter to virtualize sensors and actuators not available to the Kilobot and to automatize the collection of data essential for the analysis of the experiments.},

Then processed data are pushed to a data queue and the system processes the data queue using priority-based scheduling algorithm. Ultimately processed data are loaded to real-time data warehouse to support decision analysis. After analysis of a test case, this method can capture all changed data coming from the source data in time without changing the structure of the source system, and has a little impact on system performance to the source system. In addition, the real-time scheduling algorithm can effectively improve the data quality and data freshness of the real-time data warehouse to give a better data support for business's routine tactical decision.},

Swarm robots comprise of many analog and digital sensors. They can be humidity, temperature, ultrasonic, {IR} sensors, light dependant resistors ({LDR}) and many more. Each swarm robot transmits information to its neighbor swarm robot as well as to the control room. It is necessary to acquire real time data (in graphical format) from swarm robots to know the condition of the environment in which swarm robots work. However the actual concept of swarm robotics is not described here. This work deals with only real time wireless multichannel data acquisition. Here just a reference of swarm robots has been taken. Each swarm robot has Arduino {UNO} microcontroller and {WIRDIN} 1186 wireless module for transmitting the information to the control room. Control room has another {WIRDIN} 1186 wireless module to receive the information from the sensors mounted on swarm robots. Control room receives the information in Matlab graphical user interface. The technique of finding root locus of the acquired signal is also described. In a nut shell the intention is to show the multichannel wireless real time data acquisition technique.},

Their inexpensive and accessible nature makes them useful for a number of broad applications including agriculture, infrastructure inspection, and more. In response to this popularity, {UAV} manufacturers, hobbyists, and researchers have developed myriad software packages for {UAV} control to simplify and automate {UAV} flight. Recent advances have also led to autonomous {UAV} that complete complex missions without human pilots and swarms of {UAV} that work together to solve tasks. Recently, researchers have used autonomy and swarms to allow {UAV} to cover wide areas quickly and intelligently. Few software packages explicitly support either autonomy and swarming for {UAV}, and none to our knowledge combine these features. We present early work on {SoftwarePilot} 2.0, a {UAV} software package that supports swarms of autonomous {UAV}. {SoftwarePilot} 2.0 improves on prior work to expand microservice model designs which are easier to manage using cloud-native technologies. {SoftwarePilot} 2.0's edge-efficient design allows {UAV} swarms to easily scale across the edge and cloud, and supports cutting edge autonomy techniques.},

However, there is a general lack of understanding of what needs to be done for robot swarms to be useful and trusted by users in reality. This paper aims to investigate user perception of robot swarms in the workplace, and inform design principles for the deployment of future swarms in real-world applications. Three \{qualitative\} studies with a total of 37 participants were done across three sectors: fire {\textbackslash}\& rescue, storage organisation, and bridge inspection. Each study examined the users' perceptions using \{focus groups and interviews\}. In this paper, we describe our findings regarding: the current processes and tools used in these professions and their main challenges; attitudes towards robot swarms assisting them; and the requirements that would encourage them to use robot swarms. We found that there was a generally positive reaction to robot swarms for information gathering and automation of simple processes. \{Furthermore\}, a human in the loop is preferred when it comes to decision making. \{Recommendations to increase trust and acceptance are related to\} transparency, accountability, safety, reliability, ease of maintenance and ease of use. Finally, we found that mutual shaping, \{a methodology to create a bidirectional relationship between users and technology developers to incorporate societal choices in all stages of research and development\}, is a valid approach to increase knowledge and acceptance of swarm robotics. This paper contributes to the creation of such a culture of mutual shaping between researchers and users, towards increasing the chances of a successful deployment of robot swarms in the physical realm.},

The {BRICS} and European Union countries are no exception. {BRICS} as well as the European Union seek to strengthen their positions as leading actors on the world stage. At the present time, an essential means of doing so is for {BRICS} and the {EU} to implement smart policy and create suitable conditions for the development of digital technologies, including {AI}. For this reason, one of the most important tasks for {BRICS} and the {EU} is to develop an adequate approach to the regulation of {AI}-based technologies. This research paper is an analysis of the current approaches to the regulation of {AI} at the {BRICS} group level, in each of the {BRICS} countries, and in the European Union. The analysis is based on the application of comparative and formal juridical analysis of the legislation of the selected countries on {AI} and other digital technologies. The results of the analysis lead the authors to conclude that it is necessary to design ageneral approach to the regulation of these technologies for the {BRICS} countries similar to the approach chosen in the {EU} (the trustworthy approach) and to upgrade this legislation to achieve positive effects from digital transformation. The authors offer several suggestions for optimization of the provisions of the legislation, including designing a model legal act in the sphere of {AI}.},

	abstract = {The Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to the first large-scale, high intensity war where both sides have extensively deployed military and commercial drones. What the conflict has so far highlighted is that the frequently mentioned “game-changing effect” of drones on warfare depends on the game. Based on their category, drones produce distinctive military effects either as an extension of air power or as ammunition. Military thinking is therefore changing, making armed drones more politically acceptable. There is also reduced focus on the large armed and surveillance drones known from counterterrorism operations, as better integrated small drone scouts now serve land forces in combat. Far from being a mere security nuisance, small drones have yet to be effectively countered with air defenses. Military and dual-use export controls require adaptation to keep pace with these evolving battlefield realities. The drone lessons of the war in Ukraine thus point to many future challenges lying in wait for the international community.},

	abstract = {Collective migration of cells and animals often relies on a specialised set of “leaders”, whose role is to steer a population of naive followers towards some target. We formulate a continuous model to understand the dynamics and structure of such groups, splitting a population into separate follower and leader types with distinct orientation responses. We incorporate leader influence via three principal mechanisms: a bias in the orientation of leaders towards the destination (orientation-bias), a faster movement of leaders when moving towards the target (speed-bias), and leaders making themselves more clear to followers when moving towards the target (conspicuousness-bias). Analysis and numerical computation are used to assess the extent to which the swarm is successfully shepherded towards the target. We find that successful leadership can occur for each of these three mechanisms across a broad region of parameter space, with conspicuousness-bias emerging as the most robust. However, outside this parameter space we also find various forms of unsuccessful leadership. Forms of excessive influence can result in either swarm-splitting, where the leaders break free and followers are left rudderless, or a loss of swarm cohesion that leads to its eventual dispersal. Forms of low influence, on the other hand, can even generate swarms that move away from the target direction. Leadership must therefore be carefully managed to steer the swarm correctly.},

	abstract = {Many-robot systems are becoming a reality for large companies that can invest in bespoke solutions. These systems often require carefully engineered infrastructure and a central planner to coordinate the robots. Outside these controlled environments, robots typically generate a shared situational awareness of the world and state of their task. This requires sophisticated mapping, perception, and control, with changes to the environment or tasks causing challenges to robot deployment. The assumption that centralized situational awareness is needed to deal with real-world complexity may be holding back the field from deploying many-robot systems. Yet potential applications are wide-ranging, including environmental monitoring, construction, agriculture, and logistics. Mainstream adoption requires usability out-of-the-box, in unstructured environments, at a reasonable cost. Distributed situational awareness is proposed as a method to design many-robot systems differently. Distributed situational awareness allows swarms of low-cost robots to rapidly and accurately capture the state of an environment and act accordingly, with no central data storage, modeling, or control. Its distributed nature enhances resilience and redundancy while reducing reliance on infrastructure and central planners. Deploying distributed situational awareness however requires new tools to design hardware and algorithms, demonstrate that it works and is safe, and is intuitive for users of the swarm.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in technology are delivering robots of reduced size and cost. A natural outgrowth of these advances are systems comprised of large numbers of robots that collaborate autonomously in diverse applications. Research on effective autonomous control of such systems, commonly called swarms, has increased dramatically in recent years and received attention from many domains, such as bioinspired robotics and control theory. These kinds of distributed systems present novel challenges for the effective integration of human supervisors, operators, and teammates that are only beginning to be addressed. This paper is the first survey of human-swarm interaction ({HSI}) and identifies the core concepts needed to design a human-swarm system. We first present the basics of swarm robotics. Then, we introduce {HSI} from the perspective of a human operator by discussing the cognitive complexity of solving tasks with swarm systems. Next, we introduce the interface between swarm and operator and identify challenges and solutions relating to human-swarm communication, state estimation and visualization, and human control of swarms. For the latter, we develop a taxonomy of control methods that enable operators to control swarms effectively. Finally, we synthesize the results to highlight remaining challenges, unanswered questions, and open problems for {HSI}, as well as how to address them in future works.},

	abstract = {Swarm unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAVs}) is an approach to the coordination of multiple {UAVs} as a system, which has huge advantages on mission capabilities, such as cooperative search, border surveillance, and situation awareness. For better swarm coordination, a robust inter-{UAV} network, especially in ad hoc mode, is needed. Due to the dynamic nature of {UAV} networks owing to mobility and topology change, adapting routing quickly to topology changes is one of the key components of {UAV} networks. Based on investigating the relationship between the swarm formation control and the network topology, we propose a proactive topology-aware scheme to track the network topology change. Through simulations on Qualnet and real-world experiments with five quadrotors, the results confirmed that the proposed scheme reduces the average delay and improves routing performance significantly.},

	abstract = {Exploration of small Solar System bodies has traditionally been performed by monolithic spacecraft carrying several science instruments. However, instruments often cannot be operated simultaneously due to requirements including viewing angle, illumination, power, and data constraints. This has motivated interest in architectures in which a swarm of small spacecraft, each carrying one instrument, studies a small body after being deployed by a carrier spacecraft; such architectures hold promise to yield significant improvements in mission efficiency, increased data quality, and reduced mission duration. A key difficulty is the selection of orbits for the spacecraft, which must satisfy not only instrument requirements but also communication and data storage constraints. To address this, we propose a novel gradient-based optimization algorithm that simultaneously optimizes spacecraft orbits, observations, and communications; the approach captures instrument requirements, communication bandwidth, and memory usage, and it accommodates irregular gravity field models and surface geometries. Numerical simulations of a six-spacecraft swarm studying the 433 Eros asteroid show that the approach results in a 67.9\% increase in data returned as compared to a communication-agnostic approach. Collectively, these results enable system designers to quickly assess the end-to-end performance of multispacecraft constellations, and represent a first step toward communication-aware design of multispacecraft missions for small Solar System body exploration.},
